            The hardest thing for - not only an artist but for anybody to do is
            look themselves in the mirror and acknowledge, you know, their own
            flaws and fears and imperfections and put them out there in the open
            for people to relate to it.

            If my edge is dull, my sword is dull, and I don't want to fight
            another guy whose sword is dull. If you've got two steel swords
            going back and forth hitting each other, what's gonna happen? Both
            of them are going to get sharper. Everybody that's in the industry
            has lost their edge.

            When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me
            like I'm the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or
            Dr. Dre. You would've thought Michael Jackson walked through that
            joint off the excitement that they had.
